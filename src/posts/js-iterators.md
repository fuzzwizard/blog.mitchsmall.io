I had an eye-opening moment today:

```javascript
const letters = [...string]; 
```

When I saw this code, three thoughts, once independant and woefully ignorant of each other, converged in my brain.

1) "Oh neat, you can use a spread operator on a string."
2) "Spread operators can be used on anything with an interator, right?"
3) "You can implement iterators on any ol' object you want."

Then I was seized by a great and reightous anger: I'd be using `String.prototype.split` this whole time __like a chump__.

But the inspiration which came after, made me 


```javascript



```
