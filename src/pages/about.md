I'm Mitch, a software engineer from Central Oregon. I specialize in Javascript and other technologies -- including Sass, Pug, Markdown, Node and *unix systems. In fact, [this blog](/posts/how-its-made) is made with a few of those. At the moment, I'm part of Hack Reactor's ongoing Remote Beta program.

In a time before my computer learnin', I was smacking around my keyboard to write words: I received a Bachelors of Science in Journalism from the University of Oregon in 2014.

I'm way too invested in media, culture, games (video and otherwise), food, drink and technology. Ask me about any of these things at your peril.
